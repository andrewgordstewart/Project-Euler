Project-Euler
=============

I'm solving the project euler problems.

All the solutions are kept in /bin. Some of the solutions are self-contained, but I'm trying to develop packages (in proj_eul) with all the reusable functions and classes in order to keep the actual solutions as short as possible.

I'm putting some self-contained solutions in self_contained_solutions. duh.
